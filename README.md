# Cash Register

## Description
This program is a simple cash register. You enter a price and it will calculate the change required. If you specify an incorrect amount of change it will let you know. The program keeps track of the amount of transactions and the amount of money from all the transactions.

Use the '0' key for a price to shutdown the cash register.

## What I learned
When working with floating points they can be inaccurate and it caused issues when making change. I ended up multiplying the change by 100, rounded the change, and then divided by 100 to get it back to the correct change.

## Technologies Used
Eclipse, Java, Git
